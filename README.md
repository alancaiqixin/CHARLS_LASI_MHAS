#Intergenerational Reciprocity, Old-age Poverty (OAP) Risks, and Subjective Well-being (SWB) from the Perspective of Intergenerational Family Solidarity: Evidence from three middle-income countries (MICs)

#Our aims are to investigate the intricate relationship between intergenerational reciprocity and old-age poverty (OAP) risks within the context of intergenerational family solidarity across three middle-income countries (MICs), mainly China, India, and Mexico. Our research addresses the following key questions: a) How does intergenerational reciprocity influence the risks of OAP? b) What are the underlying mechanisms driving these phenomena? c) How can intergenerational reciprocity be harnessed to better mitigate the risks of OAP?

#The dependent variables for aim __are  absolute OAP, relative OAP, and multidimensional OAP. The independent variables are -- upward and downward intergenerational economic transfers, emotional support, sociodemographic factors, and behavioral variables. Respondentsâ€™ levels of support from their parents, children, and grandchildren serve as the basis for assessing these variables.

#Our research utilizes - three sister studies of the U.S. Health & Retirement Studies (HRS) and the harmonized longitudinal datasets drawn from the China Health and Retirement Longitudinal Study (CHARLS), the Longitudinal Aging Study in India (LASI), and the Mexican Health and Aging Study (MHAS). Our research design leverages harmonized - variables --, allowing analysis of -longitudinal - internationally comparable cross-country panel datasets. -

#Our study will allow -valuable insights into the complex interplay between intergenerational reciprocity and OAP in three unique MICs. The findings from our study have - implications for policy formulation and interventions aimed at enhancing the welfare and quality of life for older adults in the United States and in other -diverse cultural and economic contexts.
